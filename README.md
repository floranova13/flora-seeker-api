# flora-seeker-api
An API to manage the Seeker Division's database while they operate out of the wilderness settlement "Seras".

"We, the Seras Seekers, are a fledgling Flora Seeker Branch. Out here in Seras, we have unparalleled opportunity to thrive. Seras\'s Research Division has committed itself to supporting us while we get established. This API is one example of that. In turn, the Research Advocate and the Seras Council as a whole expect great things. Use the Flora Seeker Database to manage activities efficiently, and stay true to the Division guidelines!"
