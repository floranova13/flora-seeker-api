# flora-seeker-api
Using a world designed for a hobby project, this RESTful API utilizes an MVC design pattern with Express, MySQL, and Sequelize.js. It is documented with a pug view, and was my first personal API project over the course of my learning.

"We, the Seras Seekers, are a fledgling Flora Seeker Branch. Out here in Seras, we have unparalleled opportunity to thrive. Seras\'s Research Division has committed itself to supporting us while we get established. This API is one example of that. In turn, the Research Advocate and the Seras Council as a whole expect great things. Use the Flora Seeker Database to manage activities efficiently, and stay true to the Division guidelines!"
